### About the repository
This repository hosts the Matlab based code packages associated with our manuscript titled “Modeling generalized scattering matrix containing evanescent modes for 
wavefront shaping applications in disordered media”, Michael Raju, Baptiste Jayet and Stefan Andersson-Engels. In addition to the main paper, there is a supplementary 
document and a user manual. The [user manual](/User_manual.pdf)
 is provided here within the repository. It is recommended to go through the user manual first to understand the directory 
structure of the code packages. There is also a Zenodo repository (as explained in the user manual) which hosts the saved run-data. One may download the saved
run data (saved-data-Code-Package-1.mat and saved-data-Code-Package-2.mat) from 
the Zenodo repository and add it to the code package folders (Code-Package-1 and Code-Package-2) respectively. Loading the saved run data (by setting new\_run\_flag=0) 
helps to visualize the results presented in the paper, without actually performing a new computational run from the scratch. On the other hand, setting the flag 
setting new\_run\_flag=1 yields a fresh computational run, initializing a new disorder.  

### Contribution
The code packages and the associated analytical and numerical formulations were developed by Michael Raju as part of his PhD studies.
Baptiste Jayet and Stefan Andersson-Engel were involved in the PhD supervision. 
Michael wrote the manuscript, the supplementary document and the user manual with the support from the other authors. 

This repository is also associated with Michael's [PhD thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/10468/14107).
